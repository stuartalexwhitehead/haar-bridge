# Haar
Academic year 2015â€“16 is the honours year of my Computer Science degree. This repository contains a bridge application. It is used as a middleman between a ZigBee Wireless Sensor Network and the Internet.

The research and development for Haar is quite broad so the workload has been divided across a number of repositories:
- [Haar](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar) - Project overview and WiP report
- [Haar Engine](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-engine) - IoT application framework
- [Haar API](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-api) - Implementation of Haar Engine
- [Haar Dashboard](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-dashboard) - Front-end UI for Haar API
- [Haar Bridge](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-bridge) - Translation between ZigBee WSN and the Internet
- [Haar Nodes](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-nodes) - Arduino sketches and companion libraries
